This repository contains code samples created with the new <a href=http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534726&clcid=0x409>Windows.UI.Composition</a> WinRT API. Samples contained in this repository created by the Microsoft Composition team or contributors, are offered for use by the community via the MIT license. All code sample submissions are subject to review by the Microsoft Composition team before final publishing on the hub. 

The Windows.UI.Composition WinRT API is currently in preview mode and subject to change before final release later in 2015. The API itself is only available for 3rd party development on Windows Insider builds as we take in community feedback.
